Shell Prompt Jobs
========================

* Speaker   : Micah Cowan <micah@addictivecode.org>
* Available : TBD
* Length    : 10-15 minutes (mini-talk)

Description
-----------

prompt-jobs.sh is Bourne-ish shell code to colorize your shell prompt,
and add a list of currently suspended shell jobs, with little or no
configuration at all (just source it directly from your .bashrc and
you're done!)

It works great in every major Bourne-style shell, including bash, ksh, zsh,
and dash.

This talk would be a short demonstration of prompt-jobs's features and use.
