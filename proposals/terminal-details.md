Exploring Your Terminal
========================

* Speaker   : Micah Cowan <micah@addictivecode.org>
* Available : TBD
* Length    : 60-90 minutes (I could fill hours :) )

Description
-----------

This talk isn't directly related to the shell. But hey, we all run our
shell programs in terminal emulators... this talk is about those!

The talk covers details about how terminals work, and how programs
communicate with them. It covers information about:

* An overview of terminal history
* Terminal control sequences
* How the termcap and terminfo frameworks manage
information about terminals for consumption by console applications
* Using the "tput" command to take advantage of terminal features in
your shell scripts
* Advanced terminal features such as
 * flow control
 * local echo
 * raw processing mode
 * changing the EOF, suspend, or interrupt keys
* Why certain silly ASCII characters exist
* How to record and playback terminal sessions, and even edit them into
demos.

I have previously done a version of this talk for LUGOD (Linux Users
Group of Davis, CA).
