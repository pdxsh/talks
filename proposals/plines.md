Description
-----------

Plines is a framework for building complex command-line applications in
Bourne-compatible shell code, by allowing one to define command-line
options that manipulate named sections of a shell pipeline.

It serves as the platform for Niwt, an unfinished replacement for GNU
Wget, which is built out of discreet, composable programs joined in a
pipeline

Plines is experimental, and is itself written in sh, which is both
unnecessary and a pretty bad idea. But it works, and serves as a good
example of how the Bourne shell can be used as the basis for large and
reasonably complex software projects.
